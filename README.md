# Binary-Tree
Solution for "Binary Tree Inorder Traversal"

The inorderTraversal method implements an iterative inorder traversal using a stack. It traverses the tree in the left-root-right order, pushing nodes onto the stack for later visitation and adding their values to the result list. This ensures that the nodes are visited in the correct inorder sequence and that their values are returned appropriately.
